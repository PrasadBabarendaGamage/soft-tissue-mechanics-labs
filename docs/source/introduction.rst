Welcome to the soft tissue mechanics labs, which will take you through the following topics:

- :ref:`Lab 1: Analysing deformation in isotropic materials <lab1>`

- :ref:`Lab 2: Stress transformations <lab2>`

- :ref:`Lab 3: Analysing stresses in anisotropic materials <lab3>`

These labs make use of the OpenCMISS computational modelling software that will be outlined in the next section.
