This lab will make use of the `OpenCMISS <http://opencmiss.org/>`_ computational modelling software being developed at the `Auckland Bioengineering Institute <http://www.abi.auckland.ac.nz/en.html>`_. This software includes a computational back-end named Iron that runs simulations, and a font-end graphical user interface (GUI) named Neon that is used to visualise the results. For the purpose of these labs, we will only be interacting with the Neon GUI that has been set up with a series of simple computational models for analysing stresses and strains in isotropic and anisotropic materials.
